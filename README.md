# CSCI561-Artificial-Intelligence
Projects developed as part of the "Foundations of Artificial Intelligence" course at University of Southern California.

## Homework 1
Implementation of Alpha Beta Pruning and Minimax Algorithm for  a laser game where we were given a high level of the problem statement and a time constraint of running each input case under 1 minute. The goal of the game was to cover as many squares on the grid as possible by placing the laser optimally at each move. Our algorithm needed to win against the professor's game playing algorithm in order to earn full credit 

## Homework 2
Constraint Satisfaction Solution for Airplane Scheduling was deisgned based on multiple constraints defined in the problem, this problem required the optimal landing and takeoff times for each plane to be generated based on the constraints as well as time limit provided. The solution uses depth first search with backtracking. 

## Homework 3
Solution to a Grid World game was designed using the Markov Decision Process.
